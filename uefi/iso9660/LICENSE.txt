 File System Wrapper License
=============================

The various parts of the File System Wrapper source code come from
different sources and may carry different licenses. Here's a quick
account of the situation:

 * The core code was written from scratch and is covered by a
   BSD-style license.

 * The EFI host driver was written from scratch, possibly using code
   from the TianoCore project and Intel's EFI Application Toolkit. It
   is covered by a BSD-style license.
